Design a Java program for a vehicle tracking system. Create variables to store a vehicle's ID, speed, and fuel level.
 Implement a method to update these values and another to display the vehicle's status. Use meaningful variable names following Java conventions. 
 Ensure that the speed is non-negative and the fuel level is between 0 and 100.
  Input: A single line containing the vehicle ID (string), speed (float), and fuel level (float) separated by spaces.
   Output: A single line with the formatted vehicle status.

Sample Input 1:

ABC123 65.5 75.0
Explain code
Sample Output 1:

Vehicle ABC123: Speed = 65.5 km/h, Fuel = 75.0%
